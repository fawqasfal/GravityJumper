GAME DETAILS
============
youre a colorful but decidedly aloof character in a bright, sunny world. you can only move left and right (your legs only move too, your arms and head motionless as you shuffle along), and flip your gravity (which is much more kickass than jumping). all of a sudden a cluster of angry dark black red clouds, so angry they vigorously shake to and fro in the air out of anger, so angry theyre willing to chase you down (albeit pretty slowly cause theyre so busy being angry) and TAKE YOUR MONEY OUT OF YOUR WALLET! (which you only have $1k of anyways)! Thankfully you have DEADLY FEET which, on contact with an enemy, takes your money AND THEIRS back (you get a lot more back from enemies than they from you, i assume they scare the dollars into reproducing), kills the enemy (but prompts them to send a last dying message to their cluster, which in turn causes an enemy to spawn anew somewhere else). but if you contact them with anything except your deadly feet, they take away your money! and be careful, because the contrast between the ultra-sachharine world and the evil, angsty clouds greatly confuses our protagonist, limiting his lifespan to just 300 seconds! gain as much money from your enemies as possible before your inevitable death!
